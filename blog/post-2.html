         In November 2023, the Brazilian non-profit organization Coding Rights held a workshop on their project 
         <a href="https://www.cartografiasdainternet.org/en">Map of Internet Territories</a> in Campinas, 
        South-East Brazil. When I arrived at the Fazenda Roseira, where the workshop would be hosted, the chairs
        had been placed in a circle and a <i>Cartography</i> poster was hanging on the wall. Mari Tamari, co-director
        of Coding Rights, presented the organization. Since 2015, Coding Rights brings a transfeminist perspective to
        digital technologies and their socio-environmental impact. Participants to the workshop were of different ages
        and backgrounds, particularly from electrical engineering, communications, and political activism.

   The <i>Cartografias da Internet</i> is a map of internet infrastructures, representing the material aspect of the 
        internet, made of cables, servers, computers, antennas, etc. Some of the questions that inspired the project 
        are: <i>Where is all the electronic waste being disposed of? Who benefits from connectivity, and who is left 
            behind? What values are embedded in the algorithms? Who profits? Who is surveilled? What are the colonial 
            relations that remain in digital technologies?</i> Users can navigate the map by clicking on graphic icons
        to read in-depth information about each element mapped: extraction of mineral resources, internet connection 
        ratio per inhabitant, connectivity infrastructures, labour, mainstream hardware and software producers, main 
        destinations of electronic waste, highest concentration of servers, and consumption of water and energy in relation
        to digital technologies.

    </p>

    <p>
       The Map of Internet Territories makes digital colonialism visible, by showing how the infrastructures of the internet
        are built upon the scaffolding of European settler colonialism. Digital colonialism, introduced by Brazilian scholars
        <a href="https://www.boitempoeditorial.com.br/produto/colonialismo-digital-152312">Deivison Faustino and Walter Lippold</a>,
        identifies the power relations between ‘Global North’ and ‘Global South’ in internet infrastructures – a continuation of
        colonial relations <i>through</i> infrastructures, at the different stages of design, development, distribution, and waste
        disposal. The map shows why “having bad connection” has rarely been a problem for me, as a European, but was mentioned by
        more than one participant at the workshop. Europe has the highest concentration of internet connection ratio per habitant and
        concentration of servers, similarly to the US – where mainstream hardware and software producers are based. Brazil is fully pink,
        indicating it is a place where mineral resources are extracted; Gold and Tantalum in Minas Gerais, Goiàs and the north, where
        Aluminum, and Copper are also extracted. The servers are concentrated in the South-East part of the country, an extension, 
        one could say, of the inequalities between the northern and southern parts of Brazil. In this sense, I see Coding Rights’ 
        Cartography of the Internet as a cartography of infrastructural inequalities.

       We live in deeply unequal societies. Structural inequalities are the systematic and institutionalized disadvantages 
        that certain social groups face relative to others regarding access to resources, opportunities, and rights. They
        are rooted in policies, social norms, laws – and infrastructural choices. This is where the concept of infrastructural
        inequalities becomes relevant. Infrastructural inequalities identify the structural forms of inequality that are 
        reproduced by, and embedded within, infrastructures. These have already been <a href="https://infrastructuralinequalities.net/issue-1/")>recognized</a>
        in relation to infrastructures for water, electricity, or transportation. Access to clean water and reliable electricity
        is unevenly distributed, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2399654419861110">for example
        </a>: poorer neighborhoods often experience more precarious electricity supply and, consequently, less stable internet
        connection. Likewise, as shown on a macro-level (though not necessarily exhaustively) by Coding Rights’ Cartography,
        the infrastructures of the Internet are unevenly distributed.

    </p>

    <p>
        Today, we witness a massive shift of public governance towards data-driven infrastructure. These 
        <a href=https://datagovlab.net/index.html>data infrastructures
        with regulatory functions</a> – such as digital identity systems, biometric
        databases, education technologies and digital health -  increasingly mediate access to citizenship, mobility, and care.
        As recounted by researcher  <a href=https://virginia-eubanks.com/automating-inequality/)>Virginia Eubanks</a>, 
        algorithmic-driven decision-making systems are presented as objective, but they make mistakes, and those mistakes are
        <a href=https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2019/12/nist-study-evaluates-effects-race-age-sex-face-recognition-software>patterned</a>. 
        The three case studies analysed by Eubanks – state implementation of automated eligibility systems, coordinated databases,
        and predictive risk models in the US - show that these mistakes disproportionally affect the poor through biased predictive
        algorithms. These <a href=https://www.berghahnjournals.com/view/journals/cja/42/1/cja420108.xml>Regulatory Data Infrastructures
        </a> – by shifting decision-making to biased algorithmic systems – contribute to <i>automating inequality</i>.

    </p>

    <p>
         Beyond algorithmic bias, investigating infrastructural inequalities allows us to relocate inequality from the software to the
        infrastructural level, including the material level of data infrastructures – the hardware components – as well as the institutional
        arrangements – standards, policies and protocols that define the rules of functioning of regulatory data infrastructures. While these
        systems are often promoted as efficiency-improving and security-enhancing solutions, I cannot help but wonder: for whom do these 
        regulatory data infrastructures improve access to resources, opportunities and rights, and for whom do they (re)produce more hurdles
        and challenges? In other words, do regulatory data infrastructures (re)produce (infra)structural inequalities?
